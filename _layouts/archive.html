    <p style="font-size:12pt">
      I am recent graduate of the Toulouse School of Economics, where I received my Masters in Econometrics and Empirical Economics and managed to finish top of my class.
      My main areas of interest are machine learning, efficiency analysis and climate change.
      Currently, I am participating in a coding challenge hosted by Capgemini and Microsoft with the objective of using image recognition models to predict
      carbon emissions, biodiversity, and solar potential from aerial images.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:12pt">
      My main analytical tools are Python, R and SQL. I also have some experience with STATA and Matlab. I frequently use Latex for drafting reports and presentations.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:12pt">
      When I am not wrangling with data, I like to dive into political, philosophical and economic literature, as well as non-scientific articles on physics.
      I get excited thinking about future societal challenges and the characteristics of a just and efficient system.
