    <p style="font-size:12pt">
      I am recent graduate of the Toulouse School of Economics, where I received my Masters in Econometrics and Empirical Economics. My main areas of interest are the intersections of housing, transportation, city design, climate, and energy. I am open to and looking for work that is ideally somewhere on the venn diagram of these fields. Currently, I am participating in a coding challenge through Capgemini and Microsoft with the objective of using image recognition models to predict carbon emissions, biodiversity, and solar potential from aerial images.

    <p style="font-size:12pt">
      My main analytical tools are Python, R and SQL. I also have some experience with STATA and Matlab. I frequently use Latex for building reports and presentations.

      I am an avid podcast listener, and stay up to date with 99% invisible, Throughline, Planet Money, and The War on Cars. I am also a regular reader of Bloomberg City Lab, Streetsblog, Strong Towns, BikePortland (a local biking blog), and Eater PDX (a local restaurant blog). In my free time, I enjoy hiking, biking, ping pong, mushroom hunting, and cooking.
