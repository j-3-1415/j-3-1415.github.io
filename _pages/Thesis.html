			This project was submitted as my second year master thesis at Toulouse School of Economics, with external supervision from Ralph Ossa,
			Chairman of the Economics Department at University of Zurich.
			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>
				For my master thesis I developed a framework that allows for measuring trade flow resilience.
				I started by operationalizing the notion of resilience and showed that it entails two dimensions: recovery and reorientation.
				I then outlined how both dimensions can be parametrized in smooth autoregressive transition models, a type of time series model.
				To guide practical application of the novel measure I tested its properties in a simulation framework and noted possible caveats.
				Lastly, I measured the resilience of German car exports and US electronics imports and found that cultural
				proximity between countries correlates positively with resilient trade.
			</p>
			<h2>Data Sources</h2>
			<p>
				The data for the Monte Carlo simulation is based on 3 simulated data generating processes.
				The data for the empirical application comes from UN Comtrade monthly database.
			</p>
			<h2>Tools Used</h2>
			<p>
				The paper was built using LaTex. The coding was done in R and Matlab, using the tsDyn and forecast package as well as geospatial packages for visualizations.
				Code is available upon request.
